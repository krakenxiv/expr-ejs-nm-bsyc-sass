# expr-ejs-nm-bsyc-sass
Working example of expressjs, ejs, nodemon, browsersync, and sass with live refresh. Flex layout. I spent a lot of time looking for working examples of this and almost every example had pieces that did not work.

The directory structure is currently a mess. Will be cleaning up in the near future.

To install clone the repo and run npm install. After installation the site can be launched with gulp watch.
